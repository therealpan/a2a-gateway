# 🌍 A2A Gateway – Vision

## Why We Exist

AI agents are becoming more powerful, but also more isolated.

Different frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI) build incredible tools — yet they rarely speak the same language. Claude can't talk to GPT. Your internal tools don't integrate with public APIs. Local LLMs stay siloed.

We believe in a different future.

A2A Gateway is our contribution toward an **interoperable, federated ecosystem of AI agents** — one where systems can collaborate, compose, and delegate across boundaries.

Built on [Google’s A2A protocol](https://google.github.io/A2A), this project isn't trying to reinvent agents — it exists to connect them.

## Our Values

### 🧠 Interoperability First  
We prioritize openness, standard protocols, and language-agnostic interfaces. Your agent can be in Python, Go, Node.js or anything else — if it speaks A2A, it can join.

### 🧪 Minimal and Hackable  
We aim for tools that are simple, composable, and easy to fork. Less is more — and it's your stack, not ours.

### 🌱 Community-Grown  
We see this project as an open agora — a shared space to build together, challenge ideas, and grow a living network of agents and developers.

We welcome:

- tinkerers and builders
- researchers and hackers
- dreamers and skeptics

No contribution is too small. A question, a badge, a single agent card — all help shape this.

## Our Dream

Imagine:

- A GPT-based bot collaborates with your open-source Claude agent
- A local medical LLM talks securely to a legal reasoning API
- A marketplace of modular agents, each composable like LEGO bricks
- An open registry where agents can be discovered, trusted, and extended

This isn’t science fiction — it’s already possible. We just need to build it, together.

## Your Role

You don't need to be an expert. If you're curious and care about the future of collaborative AI, you’re already one of us.
