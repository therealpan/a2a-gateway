# 🤝 Contributing to A2A Gateway

First off, thank you for your interest in A2A Gateway!  
Whether you're here to fix a typo, publish an agent, improve the CLI, or simply share an idea — **you’re already part of the crew** 🚀

## 🌟 Our Vision

**A2A Gateway** is more than a codebase — it’s an open agora for everyone passionate about making AI agents interoperable.

We believe in:
- Open standards over walled gardens
- Collaboration over silos
- Real, working agents over theoretical architectures

If that resonates with you, we’d love to build with you.
